                    <p>
                        Once feared for being high in cholesterol, whole eggs have been making a comeback.Although a high intake of eggs raises the levels of “bad” LDL-cholesterol in some people, they are one of the best foods to eat if you need to lose weight. They are high in protein and fat, and are very satiating.(1Trusted Source, 2Trusted Source). One study in 30 overweight women showed that eating eggs for breakfast, instead of bagels, increased feelings of fullness (satiety) and made participants eat less for the next 36 hours (3Trusted Source).
                        Another eight-week study found that eggs for breakfast increased weight loss on a calorie restricted diet, compared to bagels (4Trusted Source).
                        Eggs are also incredibly nutrient dense and can help you get all the nutrients you need on a calorie-restricted diet. Interestingly, almost all the nutrients are found in the yolks.

                    <p>
                        Eggs are very filling and nutrient-dense. Compared to refined carbs like bagels, eggs can suppress appetite later in the day and may even promote weight loss.

                        Leafy greens include kale, spinach, collards, swiss chards and a few others.
                        They have several properties that make them perfect for a weight loss diet, such as being low in calories and carbohydrates and loaded with fiber.
                        Eating leafy greens is a great way to increase the volume of your meals, without increasing the calories. Numerous studies show that meals and diets with a low energy density make people eat fewer calories overall (5Trusted Source).                   
                        Leafy greens are also incredibly nutritious and very high in many vitamins, antioxidants and minerals, including calcium, which has been shown to aid fat burning in some studies (6Trusted Source).

                    <p>
                        Fatty fish like salmon is incredibly healthy and very satisfying, keeping you full for many hours with relatively few calories.
                        Salmon is loaded with high-quality protein, healthy fats and various important nutrients.                              
                        Fish — and seafood in general — may also supply a significant amount of iodine.                                
                        This nutrient is necessary for proper thyroid function, which is important to keep your metabolism running optimally (7Trusted Source).                              
                        Studies show that a significant number of people don’t fill their iodine needs (8Trusted Source).
                        Salmon is also loaded with omega-3 fatty acids, which have been shown to help reduce inflammation, which is known to play a major role in obesity and metabolic disease (9Trusted Source, 10Trusted Source).                            
                        Mackerel, trout, sardines, herring and other types of fatty fish are also excellent.

                        Like other vegetables, they’re high in fiber and tend to be incredibly filling.                               
                        What's more, these types of veggies generally contain decent amounts of protein.                             
                        They're not nearly as high in protein as animal foods or legumes but still high compared to most vegetables.                               
                        A combination of protein, fiber and low energy density makes cruciferous vegetables the perfect foods to include in your meals if you need to lose weight.                              
                        They’re also highly nutritious and contain cancer-fighting substances (11Trusted Source).

                        Meat has been unfairly demonized.It has been blamed for various health problems despite a lack of good evidence to back up these negative claims.
                        Though processed meat is unhealthy, studies show that unprocessed red meat does not raise the risk of heart disease or diabetes (12Trusted Source, 13Trusted Source).
                         According to two big review studies, red meat has only a very weak correlation with cancer in men and no correlation at all in women (14Trusted Source, 15Trusted Source).
                        The truth is, meat is a weight-loss-friendly food because it's high in protein.
                        Protein is by far the most filling nutrient, and eating a high-protein diet can make you burn up to 80–100 more calories per day (16Trusted Source, 17Trusted Source, 18Trusted Source).
                        Studies have shown that increasing your protein intake to 25–% of daily calories can cut cravings by 60%, reduce your desire for late-night snacking by half and cause weight loss of almost one pound (0.45 kg) per week (19Trusted Source, 20Trusted Source).
                        If you're on a low-carb diet, feel free to eat fatty meats. However, if you're on a moderate- to high-carbohydrate diet, choosing lean meats may be more appropriate.

                        White potatoes seem to have fallen out of favor for some reason.
                        However, they have several properties that make them a perfect food — both for weight loss and optimal health.
                        They contain an incredibly diverse range of nutrients — a little bit of almost everything you need.
                        here have even been accounts of people living on nothing but potatoes alone for extended periods of time.
                        They’re particularly high in potassium, a nutrient that most people don't get enough of and that plays an important role in blood pressure control.
                        On a scale called the Satiety Index, which measures how filling different foods are, white, boiled potatoes scored the highest of all the foods tested (21Trusted Source).
                        What this means is that by eating white, boiled potatoes, you will naturally feel full and eat less of other foods.
                        If you allow potatoes to cool for a while after boiling, they will form high amounts of resistant starch, a fiber-like substance that has been shown to have various health benefits, including weight loss (22).
                        Sweet potatoes, turnips and other root vegetables are also excellent.

                        It’s lean fish, meaning it’s low in fat.
                        Tuna is popular among bodybuilders and fitness models who’re on a cut, as it's a great way to increase protein intake while keeping total calories and fat low.
                        If you're trying to emphasize protein intake, make sure to choose tuna canned in water, not oil.

                        Some beans and other legumes can be beneficial for weight loss.
                        They also tend to contain some resistant starch.
                        The main problem is that a lot of people have difficulties tolerating legumes. For this reason, it’s important to prepare them properly.
                        These foods tend to be high in protein and fiber, which are two nutrients that have been shown to lead to satiety.

                        One of the best ones is cottage cheese, which — calorie for calorie — is mostly protein with very few carbs and little fat.
                        Eating cottage cheese is a great way to boost your protein intake. It’s also very satiating, making you feel full with a relatively low number of calories.
                        Dairy products are also high in calcium, which may aid fat burning (25Trusted Source).
                        Other low-fat, high-protein dairy products include Greek yogurt and skyr.
